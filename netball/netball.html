          <h2>Origins of netball</h2>
          <p>Netball was created by accident! Basketball was invented in the United States by James Naismith in 1891. When Clara Baer, a sports teacher from New Orleans, read the rules for Naismith's new game, she misinterpreted them - and this is how netball was born!</p>
          <p>Specifically, Baer thought the lines on a basketball court indicated restricted areas of play, whereas Naismith only intended them as useful guidelines for players.</p>
          <p>In basketball, players can travel anywhere on the court, but the result of Baer's interpretation was a game in which players are confined to certain areas of the court based on the position they play.</p>
          <p>In 1899, these rules became part of 'women's basketball', which eventually came to be known as netball. Of course, nowadays, people of all genders can play both netball and basketball.</p>

          <h2>The basics of the game</h2>
          <p>
            Netball is played in teams of 7. A game lasts 60 minutes and is
            usually played in 4 quarters and teams can
            discuss strategy and make substiutions in the breaks. The following equipment is needed:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>A rectangular court marked with netball lines (see image below).</li>
            <li>A raised hoop at each end of the court.</li>
            <li>A ball.</li>
            <li>7 bibs per team to indicate player positions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            There is a raised hoop at the end of each court and the aim is to
            score points by throwing the ball through your team's scoring hoop.
            You also need to prevent the opposition from scoring by proteting
            your defending hoop.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are only 2 shooting positions on each team, and those players
            can only score when they are standing inside the 'goal circle'
            that is marked on the floor beneath the hoop. The team gets one point per goal scored and
            the winning team is the one with the most points at the end of the
            match.

            <h2>Key rules</h2>
              <p>
               Top players know all sorts of tips and tricks, but the fundamental
                rules of netball are...
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Players can only enter the area of the court that their position
                  allows.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Players cannot move whilst holding the ball. You have to pass or
                  shoot from the spot where you catch the ball.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Players can hold the ball for a maximum of 3 seconds before passing
                  or taking a shot.
                </li>
                <li>You cannot make contact with other players.
                </li>
                <li>
                  You can intercept passes and shots, but you cannot grab the ball
                  when another player is holding it.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If break any of these rules, the opposition will gain possession of
                the ball and you may face other penalties too.
