                She is still the most dominant force in any shooting circle and
                a nightmare for any defender or coach to face. Her take and
                strength on the ball is incredible, her shooting accuracy is
                frightening, and more importantly she is still adding to her
                game especially with her circle release and offloads. - TAMSIN
                GREENWAY, former international player and current head coach of
                Scotland.

                As the confetti streamed down from the ceiling Breanna Stewart
                took in the scene. It's every athlete's dream to be crowned the
                National Champion of their sport, but it's something entirely
                different to do it four years in a row. She didn't get here the
                easy way, instead, it was countless hours in a gym working on
                her craft. - JACKSON CARTER, Breanne Stewart biographer.
