            <h2 class="info">History of Basketball</h2>
            <p>James Naismith was a 31-year old graduate student teaching physical education at the International YMCA Training School, 
                now known as Springfield College, in Springfield, Massachusetts when students were forced to stay indoors for days due 
                to a New England storm. The usual winter athletic activities were marching, calisthenics, and apparatus work but they 
                weren’t nearly as thrilling as football or lacrosse which were played during the warmer seasons. </p>
            <p>Naismith wanted to create a game that would be simple to understand but complex enough to be interesting. The game had to 
                be playable indoors, and it had to accommodate several players at once. The game also needed to provide plenty of exercise 
                for the students, yet without the physicality of football, soccer, or rugby since those would threaten more severe injuries 
                if played in a confined space.</p>
            <p>Naismith approached the school janitor, hoping he could find two square boxes to use for goals. When the janitor came back 
                from his search, he had two peach baskets instead. Naismith nailed the peach baskets to the lower rail of the gymnasium 
                balcony, one on each side. The height of that lower balcony rail happened to be 10 feet. The students would play on teams 
                to try to get the ball into their team’s basket.  A person was stationed at each end of the balcony to retrieve the ball 
                from the basket and put it back into play.</p>

            <h2 class="info">Original Rules</h2>
            <p>Naismith didn’t create all of the rules at once, but continued to modify them into what are now known as the original 13 
                rules. Some are still part of the modern game today. In the original rules: The ball could be thrown in any direction with 
                one or both hands, never a fist.  A player could not run with the ball but had to throw it from the spot where it was caught. 
                Players were not allowed to push, trip or strike their opponents. The first infringement was considered a foul. A second foul 
                would disqualify a player until the next goal was made. But if there was evidence that a player intended to injure an opponent, 
                the player would be disqualified for the whole game.</p>
            <p>Umpires served as judges for the game, made note of fouls and had the power to disqualify players. They decided when the ball was 
                in bounds, to which side it belonged, and managed the time. Umpires decided when a goal had been made and kept track of the goals.
                If a team made three consecutive fouls, the opposing team would be allowed a goal.</p>
            <p>A goal was made when the ball was thrown or batted from the grounds into the basket and stayed there. If the ball rested on the edges, 
                and the opponent moved the basket, it would count as a goal. When the ball went out of bounds, it was thrown into the field of play 
                by the person first touching it. The person throwing the ball was allowed five seconds; if he held it longer, the ball would go to 
                the opponent. In case of a dispute, an umpire would throw the ball straight into the field. If any side persisted in delaying the game, 
                the umpire would call a foul on that side.</p>    
            <p>The length of a game was two 15-minute halves, with five minutes' rest between.  The team making the most goals within the allotted time 
                was declared the winner. If a game was tied, it could be continued until another goal was made.</p>
